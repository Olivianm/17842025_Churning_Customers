Customer churn refers to loss of customers or subscribers for any reason at all. This project is aimed to give a prediction of the customer churning using different inputs. After data processing, I split the data to get the traing and testings.

I have used keras and MLP to fine tune and test the model. After optimization, I was able to get the best MLP model whose accuracy was about 83%. 

The model deployment I saved the model using the pickle. I used streamlit to deploy the method, which was successfully.
